Speedometer is a SwiftUI library that provides customizable speedometer gauges for iOS applications. It includes a variety of components and configurations to create an animated speedometer with indicator lines and labels. 
This project is part of my exercise with SwiftUI drawings and is not intended to be a production-ready component. It's also worth mentioning that it is not fully flexible.
