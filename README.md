Speedometer is a SwiftUI library that provides customizable speedometer gauges for iOS applications. It includes a variety of components and configurations to create an animated speedometer with indicator lines and labels. 
This project is part of my exercise with SwiftUI drawings and It's also worth mentioning that it needs to be more flexible.


Features
Customizable speedometer gauge: Easily adjust the number of segments, steps, and animation duration.
Animated needle: Smoothly animates the needle as the speed changes.
Indicator lines: Displays indicator lines and labels for each segment.
Reusable shapes: Modular design with reusable shapes for drawing arcs and lines.



Customizing the Gauge
You can customize the GaugeView with parameters such as animation duration, progress, number of segments, step interval for major indicator lines, and font size for the indicator labels.
